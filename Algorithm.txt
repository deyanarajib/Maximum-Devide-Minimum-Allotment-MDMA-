MDMA Algorithm

Step 1: Construct the Transportation Table (TT) for the given Pay Off Matrix (POM).
Step 2: Choose the maximum element(ME) from POM and divide all elements by the ME in the Constructed Transportation Table (CTT).
Step 3: Supply the demand for the minimum element newly CTT.
Step 4: Select the next maximum element in CTT and repeat the same procedure for remaining allotments
